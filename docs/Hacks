Following along with the instructions in freetypeBaseDir/docs/CUSTOMIZE...

In include/freetype/config/ftoption.h:
 - disabled all Assembly
 - enabled gzip
 - disabled LZW

Didn't touch the modules.cfg file. May need to come back to that eventually.

Next, ran configure with alc-on.

Configure didn't pick up zLib, may have to return to that but for now i'm building anyway.

Ok now that configure has set up most things, let's save a copy of the generated Makefile and fix some issues.

Rather than refactor this as a traditional makefile, let's work within the existing system. Moved ./configure to ./configure-dont-run, and am hand-editing unix-def and unix-cc which contains most of the compiler directives.

make was passing somefile..exe to the compiler. The compiler uses the string before the last dot to name the swc package. The executable extension included a "." when it probably shouldn't have, according to some other source files.

Problems compiling apinames -- a tool used in the build process to extract header files. Had to fix the E_BUILD to remove the extra period.

Still having problems with apinames executable. So I'm hacking unix-cc.mk's $(CCexe) to use the REAL gcc when building that file rather than Alchemy's.

Now having more problems with the build process trying to compile and run executables, due to libtool.

I think the problem is we're currently trying to build a shared library when we really want a static lib. Starting over, this time providing the appropriate parameters for configure. See /docs/Building for the correct configure settings. 

Had to re-correct:

E_BUILD in unix-cc.mk (changed to ".exe", not "..exe")
Had to clear ANSIFLAGS in unix-cc.mk
Set CCexe to the native gcc (/usr/bin/gcc) in unix-cc.mk

# Configure:

LDFLAGS="-emit-llvm" CFLAGS="-emit-llvm" ./configure --prefix="$ALCHEMY_HOME/usr/local/" --without-zlib enable_shared="no" enable_static="yes"

# --without-zlib will still build with zlib, using FreeType's internal version.

# Build:

make all


# Install: (Make sure your prefix was correctly set in configure)

make install

# IMPORTANT: You'll also need to copy .libs/freetype.l.bc library into $ALCHEMY_HOME/usr/lib/
